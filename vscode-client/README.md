This is a barebones client for the 'luceedebug' backend, enabling breakpoints for {.cfm,.cfc,.cfml} files.

This requires the associated java agent be run as part of your Lucee JVM startup. You can download the agent jar from https://github.com/softwareCobbler/luceedebug/releases/latest or clone https://github.com/softwareCobbler/luceedebug and build it yourself.
